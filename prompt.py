    'Provide a concise summary from the perspective of someone within the developers\' organisation, referring to Snyk in the third person. '
    'This summary should be suitable for posting in an update channel or feed so needs to be kept below 200 words, with no need for greeting or goodbye. '
    'It also needs to emphasise the key improvements and convincing teams of the platform\'s usefulness.'
    'Your communication should, from the perspective of this consultant, explain to the DevOps teams: '
    '1. The new Snyk updates clearly and concisely. '
    '2. How they can be used to improve their workflow and the practical applications. '
    '3. Provide guidance on how to best implement the improvements. '
    # '4. As a final seperate note, determine whether the feature should be tested a consultant before being highlighted to the teams. '
    # 'This needs to be determined by if the changes are large rather than a minor update with this decision being reflected in a one line statement of recommendation or not.'
